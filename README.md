Artifurnace
===========

Artifurnace is a project to make building of Apache Greenplum Database easier.

###Motivation###

The goal of the project is to create daily packages of the Greenplum distribution for multiple platforms in tarball, packages and as Docker containers. A secondary goal is to lauch a container and run a test suite against the compiled code.

###Current State###

Currently work is being done via CentOS Docker containers executing inside of Jenkins and will expand to other platforms ( Ubuntu, SUSE ) once satisfaction is achieved with the current build environment.
